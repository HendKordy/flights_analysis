I encoded the below columns.
Then I merged the new columns into the main dataframe df.
However, I didn't drop the old columns that I have encoded.
I'm waiting for your decision about these old columns that have been encoded.
I recommend that we drop these old columns since I already encoded them.
The encoded columns are:
Airlines
embarked
destination
stops
departure_time
arrival_time
